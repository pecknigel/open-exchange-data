# Open Exchange Data

This is an implementation of the application layer for the [Trading Exchange Collaborative Learning Program](https://github.com/pecknigel/trading-exchange-collaborative-learning) from the [Prescription Free Academy of Web Development and Software Engineering](https://prescriptionfree.academy/).

It constitutes a Node/Express (or Nest.js - to be decided - Marius?) API providing individual ticker prices and a list of all ticker prices, potentially with options for filtering.

See [Application Layer Interface Agreements](https://github.com/pecknigel/trading-exchange-collaborative-learning?tab=readme-ov-file#application-layer) for specification of the interface that this should provide.
