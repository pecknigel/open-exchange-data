# Open Exchange Data

This is an implementation of the application layer for the [Trading Exchange Collaborative Learning Program](https://github.com/pecknigel/trading-exchange-collaborative-learning) from the [Prescription Free Academy of Web Development and Software Engineering](https://prescriptionfree.academy/).

It constitutes a Node.js API using the Express library. It provides individual ticker prices and a list of all ticker prices, potentially with options for filtering the list.

## What’s all this about?

It’s all part of a [collaborative project](https://github.com/pecknigel/trading-exchange-collaborative-learning) for learning web development and software engineering. All backed by a highly experienced teacher who has stepped away after twenty years in software development to concentrate on teaching.

Mentoring is available as needed, seven days a week.

See [Prescription Free Academy](https://prescriptionfree.academy/).

## How to Run the Project

There is [a Postman collection](https://www.postman.com/nigelpeck/trading-exchange-collaborative-learning/collection/xr5aub1/open-exchange-data) for the API as it stands.

## Specification

See [Application Layer](https://github.com/pecknigel/trading-exchange-collaborative-learning?tab=readme-ov-file#application-layer) for more about the system layer that this project implements.

See [Application Layer Interface Agreements](https://github.com/pecknigel/trading-exchange-collaborative-learning?tab=readme-ov-file#application-layer-interface) for specification of the interface that this should provide.

## Project Management and Discussion

We’re looking to keep project management simple and housed on GitHub.

It’s currently the only places for discussion too, at least publicly.
