# Open Exchange Data

This is an implementation of the application layer for the [Trading Exchange Collaborative Learning Program](https://github.com/pecknigel/trading-exchange-collaborative-learning) from the [Prescription Free Academy of Web Development and Software Engineering](https://prescriptionfree.academy/).

It constitutes a Node/Express (or Nest.js - to be decided - Marius?) API providing individual ticker prices and a list of all ticker prices, potentially with options for filtering.

See [Application Layer](https://github.com/pecknigel/trading-exchange-collaborative-learning?tab=readme-ov-file#application-layer) for more about the system layer that this project implements.

See [Application Layer Interface Agreements](https://github.com/pecknigel/trading-exchange-collaborative-learning?tab=readme-ov-file#application-layer-interface) for specification of the interface that this should provide.

## What’s all this about?

It’s all part of a [collaborative project](https://github.com/pecknigel/trading-exchange-collaborative-learning) for learning web development and software engineering. All backed by a highly experienced teacher who has stepped away after twenty years in software development to concentrate on teaching.

Mentoring is available as needed, seven days a week.
