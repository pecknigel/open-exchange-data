# Open Exchange Data

This is an implementation of the application layer for the [Trading Exchange Collaborative Learning Program](https://github.com/pecknigel/trading-exchange-collaborative-learning).

It constitutes a Node/Express (or Nest.js - to be decided - Marius?) API providing individual ticker prices and a list of all ticker prices, potentially with options for filtering.
